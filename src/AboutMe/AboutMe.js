                <p>My interest in coding started in my early teenager years, when I self-taught HTML and created a fan website to my favourite rock band. After that I also created one website for a Volkswagen car’s dealer company. Years passed and I studied business and developed a career in marketing in global companies. Now I had the opportunity to go back to coding and I’m searching for an opportunity to join a dynamic and exciting team.</p>
